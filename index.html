            <p>Welcome to our newly updated home page. This site started out in 2009 as a way to
            keep people up to date with what we were doing in China for 8Â½ weeks and was then
            used to keep a kind of diary of our travelling ever since. However, it has now
            become something more. The geeky side of me took over and decided that we should put
            together a blog network and write not just about our travelling exploits, but about
            anything and everything else as well. So I dug into the guts of WordPress, learnt
            how to do this, built a new unified theme for the network, switched over the Jekyll,
            rebuilt the theme, twice and here we are.</p>

            <p>The latest posts for each blog are listed below.</p>
            {% for blog in site.data.blogs %}
                <section itemscope itemtype='//schema.org/Blog' class='blog'>
                    <h3 itemprop='name'>{{blog.title}}</h3>{% assign sorted_posts = (site.data.posts | sort: 'date' | reverse | where: "blog" , blog.name) %}
                    <ul>{% for post in sorted_posts limit:10 %}
                        <li itemscope itemtype='//schema.org/BlogPost'>
                            <a href='{{blog.url}}{{post.url}}' title='{{post.title}}' itemprop='url'>
                                <span itemprop='headline'>{{post.title}}</span>
                            </a>
                        </li>{% endfor %}
                    </ul>
                </section>
            {% endfor %}

        <p>
          Welcome to our newly updated home page. This site started out in 2009 as a way to
          keep people up to date with what we were doing in China for 8Â½ weeks and was then
          used to keep a kind of diary of our travelling ever since. However, it has now
          become something more. The geeky side of me took over and decided that we should
          put together a blog network and write not just about our travelling exploits, but
          about anything and everything else as well. So I dug into the guts of WordPress,
          learnt how to do this, built a new unified theme for the network and here we are.

        <p>The latest posts for each blog are listed below.</p>
        {% for blog in site.data.blogs %}
          <section itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/Blog' class='blog'>
            <h3 itemprop='name'>{{blog.title}}</h3>{% assign count = 0 %}
            <ul>{% for post in site.posts %}{% if post.blog contains blog.name %}{% assign count = count | plus: 1 %}{% endif %}{% if count > 0 and count <= 10 and post.blog == blog.name%}
              <li itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/BlogPost'>
                <a href='{{blog.url}}{{post.url}}' title='{{post.title}}' itemprop='url'>
                  <span itemprop='headline'>{{post.title}}</span>
                </a>
              </li>{% endif %}{% endfor %}

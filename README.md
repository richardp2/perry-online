# Our Digital Home

Here resides the source code for our digital home site. The site contains 'network' pages like a
global archive for all the different blogs, author pages and links to all the posts on each
individual blog site. At the beginning of 2014, after a number of years using [WordPress][wp] as my
main blogging platform, I decided it was time for a change. So, I then adopted the [Jekyll][jk]
blogging platform hosted at [GitHub Pages][gp]. 

Again, after a while I found that [GitHub Pages][gp] was quite limiting with what you can easily do
and I was running Rakefiles and separate branches for the source and the code for displaying the
site etc. I therefore started moving my sites over to [GitLab Pages][glp] in 2016 so that I could
continue to make use of the flickr plugin without the need to build the site and upload the build
separately. Now we are on [GitLab pages][glp] for most/all of the network sites and when I make
changes, or add a new post etc, I just have to push the commits to [GitLab][gl] and the pages are
built and put online automagically :smiley:

For more information about the original migration process I followed see my [blog series][bs].

This site has also been simplified and does not generate/display any of it's own posts as it did
before (_not that anyone would have known_) because I now have a better understanding of how
Jekyll works :smiley:.
